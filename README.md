### Overall Stucture of the Work
![Overall Approach](figures/SystemOverview.png)
1. We introduce a novel model-based **Network Fault Injection tool (NetFI)** that emulates the effect of communication loss, packet loss, and delay based on realistic models and data from 4G/5G networks, that can be easily integrated into any teleoperation system to simulate diverse network QoS conditions by modifying the stochastic models and their parameters.
2. We conduct **a comprehensive user study involving 15 participants** at three proficiency levels, performing a standard Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) Peg Transfer task under different network conditions, using an open-source telesurgical simulation system which integrates a state-of-the-art surgical robot simulator (SurRoL) with a surgeon console (dVTrainer, Mimic Technologies) and mechanisms for real-time logging of kinematic, video, and foot pedal data for performance evaluation. This study resulted in a multimodal dataset with MP and error labels of 180 Peg Transfer trials. 

3. Providing **new insights into the effects of different QoS degradation scenarios** on user performance and operation safety, which covers both the task and MP levels, as well as different user proficiency levels and the user experience.

### Key parameters for emulated network degradations
<img src="figures/ParameterTable.png" alt="Key parameters" width="900">

The experiments involved performing the Peg Transfer task under **four primary network conditions**: **Normal** (no degradation), **Packet Loss**, **Delay**, and **Communication Loss**. For each of **the three degradation types**, participants were exposed to **three severity levels (low:1, medium:2, high:3)**. Packet loss, delay and communication loss are denoted as PLM, DLM and CLM, respectively. 

### How to run the code
#### Computer System Requirements
Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
#### Installation
The `Mantis_Client` folder contains the dVTrainer surgeon console code, which needs to be installed and run with the device.

For the simulation part, clone the `SurRoL_dVTrainer` and go into the folder
```
git clone git@github.com:bxu765/telesurgery-qos-analysis.git
cd telesurgery-qos-analysis/SurRoL_dVTrainer/
```
Create and activate conda environment 
```
conda create -n sim python=3.7 -y
conda activate sim
```
Install SurRoL simulator dependent and other packets 
```
pip install -e .
pip install torch lz4 obs-websocket-py
cd ext/panda3d-kivy/
pip install .
```
Install [NetFI](https://github.com/UVA-DSA/NetFI) related packets
```
cd ../..
cd tests/dVTrainer/NetFI
pip install -e .
```

#### Run Simulator without dVTrainer Console
After properly setup the simulation environment, you can validate by replaying console data:
```
cd ../..
python multiple_scenes_console_replay.py
```
Select `Basic Robot Skill Training Tasks` -> `Bi-Peg Transfer` in the interface

Next, open a new terminal and go to `tests` folder and run `replay.py`
```
conda activate sim
cd telesurgery-qos-analysis/SurRoL_dVTrainer/tests
python replay.py
```
After a few seconds, the simulated robotic arms will begin moving using the recorded console packets. Upon completion, the terminal will display the following message: `Replay finished. Sent 41508 packets` Then, click blue `Exit` button on the GUI to quit and stop the connection. The console and simulated robotic arm data will be automatically generated and saved in this directory:`telesurgery-qos-analysis/SurRoL_dVTrainer/tests/dVTrainer/Data/exp_data_15`

#### Plot the Console and Simulated Robotic Trajectories
To visualize the results, open a new terminal and navigate to the `network` analysis folder to extract the console data from the `.bin` file:
```
cd telesurgery-qos-analysis/analysis/network
python analyze_network_stats_new.py
```
Next, plot the trajectories from the csv files:
```
python plot_kinematics_example.py
```
Note: If your data was saved to a different folder/file name, you will need to update the file paths in the script before running it.
#### Run Simulator with Emulated Network Condition
This teleoperation setup transmits ITP packets from the console/haptic device to the simulator via UDP. Ensure that a UDP socket connection is established and the correct **IP address and Port** are configured in `SurRoL_dVTrainer/tests/dVTrainer/Console.py` and `Net.py`.

The network conditions load from `SurRoL_dVTrainer/tests/dVTrainer/network_conditions.txt`. Each line represents one type of network condtion, for example:
```
"1 5G delay3 406 [0.89574, 0.10426] [0.01015, 0.01551]"
--"1": numbers of trial (every run this number is deducted by 1)
--"5G": one type of delay model
--"delay3": highest delay severity
--"406 [0.89574, 0.10426] [0.01015, 0.01551]": model parameters of highest delay severity
```

Run the script `random_experiment_new.py` to automatically update `network_conditions.txt` according to the user study design. 
```
cd SurRoL_dVTrainer/tests/dVTrainer
python random_experiment_new.py
```

Once the network conditions are properly configured, launch the simulation:
```
cd SurRoL_dVTrainer/tests
python test_multiple_scenes_console.py
```

Next, select `Basic Robot Skill Training Tasks` -> `Bi-Peg Transfer` in the interface and control the simulated robotic arm using the surgeon console.
